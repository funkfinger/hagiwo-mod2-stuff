# HAGIWO MOD2 Sample Player v1.0 - PlatformIO Project

This project has been converted from Arduino IDE format to PlatformIO format.

## Project Description

A digital sample player for the HAGIWO MOD2 eurorack module using the Raspberry Pi Pico (RP2040).

### Features
- Stores up to 20 seconds / 18 audio files in flash memory
- One-shot digital sample playback with 16-bit PCM samples
- 18 samples selectable via two-stage selection: group (A1) and sub-index (A2)
- Playback speed control (A0): 0.5× to 1.5× speed with linear interpolation anti-aliasing
- Trigger inputs (GPIO7 rising-edge, GPIO6 falling-edge) start playback
- Trigger LED indicator (GPIO5): lights for 20 ms on trigger
- PWM audio output (GPIO1) at ~36.6 kHz using 10-bit resolution

### Pin Assignment
- **POT1 (A0)**: Playback speed control (0.5×–1.5×)
- **POT2 (A1)**: Sample group select (1–6, 7–12, 13–18)
- **POT3 (A2)**: Sample index select within group
- **IN1 (GPIO7)**: External trigger (rising-edge)
- **IN2 (GPIO0)**: Select +6 sample number
- **CV (A2)**: Shared with POT3
- **BUTTON (GPIO6)**: Manual trigger (active-low, pull-up)
- **OUT (GPIO1)**: 10-bit PWM audio output (~36.6 kHz)
- **LED (GPIO5)**: Trigger LED indicator (20 ms pulse)

## Building and Uploading

### Prerequisites
- PlatformIO Core or PlatformIO IDE
- Raspberry Pi Pico board

### Build Commands
```bash
# Build the project
pio run

# Upload to board
pio run --target upload

# Open serial monitor
pio device monitor
```

### Configuration Notes
- Uses the `earlephilhower` Arduino core for RP2040
- Configured for Raspberry Pi Pico board
- Upload protocol set to `picotool`
- Serial monitor speed: 115200 baud
